# Fom

A social media Android app that allows peers to know where the week's events will be.

Keeping up with where friends will be in the recent future has never been faster and easier.

Make connections, join packs with your friends; and through them, make connections with their friends.

Have options on where you want to have a good time in the next few days.

# Features on the App include

* Connect with friends and meet new people in your network.
* Make or join Packs and add your friends, and they can add their friends.
* Adjust lifespan of a pack; 12 hours, 1 day, 3 days, or 7 days
* Through packs, share your possible recent locations.
* See where different packs will be in the recent days.
* Search for specific locations where you intend to be and see the different packs that will be there.
* Add pictures of yourself and your interests.
* Find local social events and make plans to meet with your friends.

The most important feature of the app is, it allows you to cease repetitively calling your peers to know where they will be and instead it opens up options for you and your friends to explore.
